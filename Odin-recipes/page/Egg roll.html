     <h2>what is an egg roll?</h2>
        <p>The egg roll is a boiled egg wrapped in a mass of dough and deep-fried.</p>
        <p>This Egg roll is often sold as street food in west Africa. However, Tea lovers can have this for breakfast. Also, you can serve it with a glass of cold juice for brunch; For me, I eat this any time of the day â€“ and I must add, it is a very filling snack.</p>
